Description: errs is a Go library for error handling
 errs is a package for making errors friendly and easy.  Errors come
 with a stack trace that is only printed when a "+" character is used in
 the format string. This should retain the benefits of being able to
 diagnose where and why errors happen, without all of the noise of
 printing a stack trace in every situation.
 .
 This package contains the library.
